__Errata corrige__

Despite our best effort, there are a few typos or imprecisions in the published version of _Bayesian Cost-Effectiveness Analysis with the R package BCEA_. We report those we have identified and welcome (well... we hope there won't be many, but you know...) notification of any other mistakes (that can be highlighted by [emailing me](mailto:g.baio@ucl.ac.uk)).

- Page 32 (Table 2.1). The first two logNormal distributions are defined in terms of precisions (`1/sdlog`), while the remaining variables modelled as logNormal are defined in terms of standard deviations.   
- Page 42 (section 2.3.2). The first line of the code should read

```{r}
#| eval: false
load(url("https://gianluca.statistica.it/BCEABook/WebMaterial/vaccine.RData"))
```
