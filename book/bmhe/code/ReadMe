The collection of R and JAGS scripts downloadable from this webpage allow you to run the examples presented in the book.
By default, the codes assume the following directories structure:


Utils.R
ch2
      MCMC.R
      modelNormal.R
      modelNormal.txt
      phbirths.dta
ch3
      HEexample.R
      model.txt
      modelEVPPI_rho.txt
      modelEVPPI_gamma.txt
ch4
      modelNormal.R
      modelNormalBlocking.txt
      modelNormal2.txt
ch5
      acupuncture.R
      dataRCTacupuncture.csv
      actptRCT.txt
      actptRCT_gamma.txt
      actptRCT_logN.txt
      EvSynth.R
      EvSynth.txt
      MarkovModel.R
      MarkovModel.txt


In other words, there is a root directory in which the utility file Utils.R and the 4 directories (one for each chapter) including the scripts for the examples are saved.

Of course, you may change the set up and save all files in a single folder, or rename the folders, or whatever. However, in that case, some commands may not work (R will typically complain about not finding files or links).
