I am a Professor of Statistics and Health Economics in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). I graduated in Statistics and Economics from the [University of Florence](https://www.disia.unifi.it/) (Italy). I then completed a PhD programme in Applied Statistics again at the University of Florence, after a period at the [Program on the Pharmaceutical Industry at the MIT Sloan School of Management](http://web.mit.edu/popi/), Cambridge (USA). I then worked as a Research Fellow and then Lecturer in the Department of Statistical Sciences at University College London (UK). 

My main interests are in Bayesian statistical modelling for cost effectiveness analysis and decision-making problems in the health systems, hierarchical/multilevel models and causal inference using the decision-theoretic approach. 

I lead the [Statistics for Health Economic Evaluation research group](https://egon.stats.ucl.ac.uk/research/statistics-health-economics/) within the department of Statistical Science. Our activity revolves around the development and application of Bayesian statistical methodology for health economic evaluation, e.g. cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analysis. We work in close collaboration with academics both within UCL and at other institutions and our activities include a series of seminars aimed at statisticians, health economists and clinicians working in economic evaluations. I collaborate with the UK [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence](https://www.nice.org.uk/) (NICE) as a Scientific Advisor on Health Technology Appraisal projects.

I have served as Secretary (2014-2016) and then Programme Chair (2016-2018) in the Section on Biostatistics and Pharmaceutical Statistics of the [International Society for Bayesian Analysis](https://bayesian.org/sectionschapters/biostatistics-and-pharmaceutical-statistics/). I have served as an Associate Editor for the [_Journal of the Royal Statistical Society_ (Series A)](https://rss.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/journal/1467985X) for the period 2015-2021 and have been a member of the Editorial Board of [_Significance_](https://www.significancemagazine.com/), the magazine of both the [Royal Statistical Society](https://www.rss.org.uk) and the [American Statistical Association](http://www.amstat.org/) in the period 2012-2021. I also am a member of the Scientific Committee of the [Bayes Workshop](http://www.bayes-pharma.org/) and a member of the technical sub-group tasked by the NHS Medical Director to review the statistical and methodological aspects related to the use of the [Summary Hospital-level Mortality Indicator](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/ci-hub/summary-hospital-level-mortality-indicator-shmi). I have been the [18th Armitage Lecturer](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/news-and-events/armitage-lectureships-and-workshops/18th-armitage-lecture-and-workshop/) in November 2021 (a full video of the talk is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yldk-QNknDc)).

I am currently the Head of the UCL Department of Statistical Science (on a 5 years term, from September 2021).

{{< fa face-grin-wink >}} My **personal** view of the world is that statisticians should be in charge of everything. And, come to think about it, ***Bayesian*** statisticians should be in charge of all statisticians.

And brexit sucks. &nbsp; ![](media/img/EU.jpg){width="40px" height="30px"}
